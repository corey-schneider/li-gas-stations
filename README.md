#### Reason
According to the California Air Resource Board, it's unsafe to live within 300 ft of a gas station<sup>[[1]](https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/news/air-resources-board-approves-land-use-planning-handbook)</sup> and potentially dangerous beyond that limit<sup>[[2]](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/news/gas-stations-vent-far-more-toxic-fumes-previously-thought)</sup>. The health risks associated with living near gas stations are substantial. Providing this map with a defined radius around gas stations can help inform a prospective home buyer or renter.
